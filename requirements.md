# 🍯 GLAZED QR Reward Page Redesign Prompt (Windurf)

## 🎯 Project Goal

Redesign the `/qr` landing page users reach after scanning the **GLAZED: Runny Honey Hair Drizzle** QR code on the packaging. This must fully match the vibrant, juicy, honey-drip, candy-gloss identity of the product — visually linked to the packaging, bottle design, and dripping pop-art goddess aesthetic.

## 🎨 Brand Identity

| Element            | Style |
|--------------------|-------|
| **Color Palette**  | Vibrant baby blue (#77C9F1), syrupy gold, bubblegum pink, cream vanilla, neon accents |
| **Texture**        | Dripping honey, gloss shine, sparkle overlays, glaze flow |
| **Tone**           | Bold, femme-forward, cheeky, empowering, sugar-slick |
| **Inspiration**    | Comic book cover art, Lisa Frank meets Glossier, digital donut shop meets high-gloss glam |
